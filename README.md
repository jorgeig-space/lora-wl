# LoRaWAN on STM32WL

This is a PoC implementation of LoRaWAN using a STM32WL MCU and [RTIC](https://rtic.rs). This example uses a NUCLEO-WL55JC board as hardware.

If you are using other boards, modify `rfswitch` accordingly to reflect your configuration.

**WIP** This is not a working implementation (yet)!

Thanks to [newAM](https://github.com/newAM), [ivajloip](https://github.com/ivajloip), and all the contributors of [stm32wl-hal](https://github.com/newAM/stm32wl-hal), [rust-lorawan](https://github.com/ivajloip/rust-lorawan) and the Rust embedded community. This wouldn't be possible without them.

## Problems

* `JoinRequest` is sent and acknowledge only below SF9. When using lower data rates (i.e. higher Spreading Factor) the gateway does not see packets.
* When `JoinAccept` is generated by the gateway, nothing is seen at the MCU.
